# SIL Translation Test



### Description
This repository is for documentation of Scripture App Builder, Reading App Builder, Keyboard App Builder, and Dictionary App Builder. It aims to keep a version history of all documents and translate them into different languages via Crowdin translation. This repository will also automatically convert, format, and output documentation.



# Setup

### Description

#### GitHub
The GitHub workflows are scripts that perform tasks automatically. This repository has only one workflow named “auto translate.” In this case, the workflow formats files, translates documents, and outputs PDFs. The workflow starts whenever a file is submitted or changed in the repository, or it can be manually started.

#### Crowdin
Crowdin is a business that provides translation software for individuals or organizations. Crowdin allows its users to create Crowdin projects where they can upload documents and download their translations. Crowdin has also created a GitHub workflow integration that allows GitHub workflows to send and receive files from Crowdin projects. This integration syncs this GitHub repository with its Crowdin project, allowing translations to be created and downloaded into a branch named "translations."

#### Tokens
In order for the GitHub workflow and Crowdin to work together, they use tokens to identify each other. Tokens are unique series of numbers (and sometimes letters) that must be copied and entered into the GitHub repository. There are three tokens that need to be generated and collected for the GitHub workflow to properly run: `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID`, `CROWDIN_GITHUB_TOKEN`, and `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN`. The user will have to add all these tokens to their proper locations in the GitHub repository. Instructions on how to do so are listed in the "Configuring tokens" section below.


#
### Configuring tokens

#### PLEASE NOTE: Some tokens can only be viewed once before becoming hidden. Make sure they are copied somewhere safe such as a notepad app before exiting the webpage. There are three tokens that need to be entered as GitHub secrets. Instructions on how to find and add the tokens are shown below.

#### CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN
1. To create the `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN`, open the Crowdin project webpage (this can be found on the left menu bar at the bottom), click on the user's Crowdin profile picture, and select "settings". This will open the Crowdin user's settings page.

![Description](README_pics/Screenshot_20260710_145305.png)

2. Then find the "API" tab and click on it.

![Description](README_pics/Screenshot_20260710_145646.png)

3. Then select "New Token" in the box labeled "Personal Access Tokens," and a screen will appear asking for a token name and permissions.

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260723_104701.png" width="400" height="800" />

4. Select "All Scopes" and enter a name for the token (This name can be anything you choose). Then select the "Create" button in the bottom-right corner.

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260723_105535.png" width="400" height="800" />

5. After that, Crowdin may or may not prompt you for your account password. If it does, fill in the password and hit confirm.

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260723_105754.png" width="700" height="1400" />

6. A token will then be generated in the middle of the screen. Click the copy button on the right side of it and paste it somewhere safe.

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260723_105833_blackedout.png" width="700" height="1400" />

7. Finally, now that the token has been generated and saved, it needs to be added to the GitHub repository secrets. This can be done either now or at a later time. If the token is going to be added now, scroll down to the "Adding tokens to GitHub secrets" section, where instructions can be found.



#
#### CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID
1. To find the `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID`, open the Crowdin project webpage (this can be found on the left menu bar at the bottom). On the right-hand side, details about the Crowdin project will be listed, including the project's ID. Click it to copy the token and save it.

![Description](README_pics/Screenshot_20260710_153219.png)
2. Now that the token has been saved, it needs to be added to the GitHub repository secrets. This can be done either now or at a later time. If the token is going to be added now, scroll down to the "Adding tokens to GitHub secrets" section, where instructions can be found.



#
#### CROWDIN_GITHUB_TOKEN
1. To generate the `CROWDIN_GITHUB_TOKEN`, open the GitHub webpage, click on the user's GitHub profile picture, and select "settings". This will open the GitHub user's settings page.

![Description](README_pics/Screenshot_20260710_154215.png)

2. Then scroll down to find the "Developer Settings" tab at the bottom of the left column and click on it.

![Description](README_pics/Screenshot_20260710_154247.png)

3. Then select "Tokens (classic)" under "Personal Access Tokens" and select "Generate new token (classic)". This will open the token creation screen.

![Description](README_pics/Screenshot_20260710_154629.png)

4. Enter the "GITHUB_TOKEN" into the "note" field and set the Expiration option to "No Expiration". Then tick the "repo", "workflow", and "write:packages" boxes. Afterward, scroll to the bottom of the webpage and select the green "Generate token" button.

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260727_121126.png" width="800" height="1200" />

5. When the token is generated and appears on screen, click the blue copy button next to the token and paste it somewhere safe.

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260727_122808_blackedout.png" width="800" height="1200" />

6. Finally, now that the token has been generated and saved, it needs to be added to the GitHub repository secrets. Instructions on how to add it can be found in the "Adding tokens to GitHub secrets" section below.



### Adding tokens to GitHub secrets
To add tokens as GitHub secrets, you must be an administrator of the GitHub repository. If you are not, you need to contact one. You can tell whether you are an administrator by scrolling to the top of the GitHub project webpage: there will be a tab labeled "settings." Please note this is a different GitHub settings tab than the one mentioned previously, as this tab is for the GitHub repository settings, while the previous one was for GitHub account settings.

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260713_125818.png" width="600" height="1000" />

If there is a settings tab, select it, and then find the "Secrets and variables" button on the left bar and select "Actions" in the drop-down menu. Then click "New repository secret."

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260713_125904.png" width="800" height="1200" />

Fill in the "name" and "secret" information and click "Add secret". Make sure you name the tokens exactly as shown below. If this is not done, then the GitHub workflow will not register the tokens and Crowdin will not work. Here are examples of what the tokens should look like with their needed names. **THESE ARE EXAMPLES AND ARE NOT REAL TOKENS**

`CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID` ≈ 346867

`CROWDIN_GITHUB_TOKEN` ≈ ghp_i7KCtEo9rUxgDZZ6k9xY4YydWZcBsP2EJUbd

`CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN` ≈ 9fcd75f1e2fa8132788171db0ca12624c65e0855d5af9391410e5402c4a7d479a39429b2d2217509

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260723_141526.png" width="800" height="1200" />

In addition, the `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID` must be manually entered into the `project_id: "XXXXXX"` field in the "crowdin.yaml" file, which is located inside the repository.

### Configuring Crowdin
To use Crowdin with this GitHub workflow, there are certain settings that need to be changed to get the best results.


#### Duplicate Strings
A setting that needs to be enabled is called "Duplicate Strings." This setting causes two sentences that are identical to be given the same translation, so Crowdin can lower the total word count.

To enable this setting, go into the "settings" tab at the very right of the project webpage.

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260720_140218.png" width="400" height="800" />

Then scroll down to the "import" bar on the left column and select it.

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260720_140247.png" width="300" height="600" />

After that, look to the right to find the "Duplicate Strings" menu and select the "Hide (strict detection)" option.

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260720_140338.png" width="1000" height="2000" />

Next, select "Skip tags" under "Word and character count". This setting also reduces the word count by not allowing data tags to be marked as words.

# How to Use

### Editing Documents

Because of the methods Crowdin and GitHub use, the process of editing documents has changed slightly.

The first difference is with the recommended document editor. While most documents are edited with Microsoft Word, this repository recommends the use of LibreOffice. LibreOffice is a free and open-source document editor which provides an identical experience to Microsoft Word. The reason for this change was to move away from the reliance on paid software. In addition, the file format used with documents has changed as well, switching from .doc or .docx to the .fodt format. This change doesn't affect the document's usage, but it requires the user to only submit documents in .fodt format.

The second difference is how images are inserted into the documents. Normally, images are fully inserted into the document, with the image data being added to the document file. However, in this repository, images are inserted as image links and not full images. This means that while the image will be displayed in the document, it is just being referenced from a separate image file located outside the document. Because of this difference, the method of adding an image has slightly changed. Images are still inserted by clicking the "Insert" tab and selecting the "Image" option; however, the "Link" checkbox must also be clicked before adding the desired image.
<!--
###### Documents
All documents need to be submitted in English, as Crowdin will handle all translations to non-English languages. All documents should be in .fodt format and should only be added (or modified) in `docs-en/fodt/(app builder name)/(file)`, for example, `"docs-en/fodt/SAB/Scripture-App-Builder-01-Installation-Instructions.fodt".`

###### Images
In this repository, images are handled differently than most other documentation repositories. Images are not inserted into the documents themselves, but instead are inserted as links pointing to separate image files. This means that every document has a folder next to it that contains all the images displayed in that document. For example, "Scripture-App-Builder-01-Installation-Instructions.fodt" would be next to a folder named SAB01. This folder would have all the images the document would use. More examples of this would be "Dictionary-App-Builder-04-Distributing-Apps.fodt" next to DAB04, and "Reading-App-Builder-07-Using-aeneas-for-Audio-Text-Synchronization.fodt" next to RAB07.

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260715_151502.png" width="300" height="600" />
<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260722_161042.png" width="300" height="600" />
<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260722_161127.png" width="300" height="600" />

The reason why this repository uses this system is that it makes it incredibly easy to switch out images in a document. Since screenshots containing English text cannot be translated by Crowdin, the next best solution is to replace these screenshots with ones containing text in the correct language. The GitHub workflow will automatically replace the screenshots; however, the user still needs to manually supply all screenshots. The images are located in images/(language)/(app builder name)/(image folder), for instance, "images/en-US/KAB/KAB02", and do not need to conform to a specific file format. Simply drop the images into the correct folder, and the workflow will handle the rest.

### Submitting Documents
A guide on how to submit documents is shown below.

1. Click on the "docs-en" folder on the GitHub project webpage. After that, click on "fodt" and then the specific app builder the documents are for (SAB, RAB, KAB, DAB).

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260730_094837_arrow.png" width="700" height="1400" />

2. On the top right side of the webpage, there will be a button that says "Add file." Click on it and select the "Upload files" button from the drop-down menu.

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260730_103716.png" width="500" height="1000" />

3. Click on the "Choose your files" button in the center of the screen and pick the files you want to upload to the folder. Then, after that is done, click the green "Commit changes" button at the bottom of the screen.

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260730_100307.png" width="700" height="1400" />

#
##### Documents
All English documents should be submitted into the `docs-en/fodt/(app builder)` folder and should not be submitted anywhere else in the repository.

Example: `docs-en/fodt/RAB/example_filename.fodt` or `docs-en/fodt/DAB/example_filename.fodt`.

#### Images
All images will be put into the `images/(language)/(app builder)` folder and should not be submitted anywhere else in the repository.

Example: `images/fr-FR/KAB/KAB02/example_filename.png` or `images/en-US/SAB/SAB07/example_filename.png`.

<img src="README_pics/Screenshot_20260713_160239.png" width="700" height="1000" />



# Outputs
The workflow will produce two types of outputs. First, it will generate all the translated files and add them to the "translations" branch. The user has the option to merge the translations branch into the main branch if they want the new documents to be easily accessible.

The second output is a .zip artifact composed of PDFs from both English and non-English languages. This can be found by going to the workflow and clicking the "Summary" button.
